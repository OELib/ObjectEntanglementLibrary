# ObjectEntanglementLibrary
Simple RPC library.

The goal of this library is to simplify data exchange between .Net applications. The main goal is to keep it lightweight, keep external dependencies to a minimum and focus on ease of use.
One of the most important goals is the minimum effort required to get it up and running. It should be easy to create a server and a client that can communicate by passing objects to each other.

We found that other libraries that solve the same problem requires a lot of dependencies and are more complex to set up. Since our focus is not on language independence or on developing a universal communication platform, we can take shortcuts to achieve our own goals.

This project is in a beta phase. There will be bugs and lots of room for improvements. Feel free to add suggestions and feedback using the Issues tab.
